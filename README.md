# Rail System

The rail system used for the Open PRT system must be highly scalable and flexible. To be the roads of the future they need to be simple and allow for innovation.

*Above rail or underneath?* There is a certain aesthetic benefit to having the rail system below the pods. It would require shorter support beams that do not get in the way of the natural habitat as much. However above the pods system would only require a single rail that the Pods can hang on to. This would possibly have the effect of achieving a smoother ride. The modifications of the Pods would be limited to one attachment that would not get in the way of a driving system because they were on top.
